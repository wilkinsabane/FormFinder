### Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: December 2024
- **Author**: FormFinder2 Development Team
- **Status**: Draft
- **Project**: FormFinder2 Enhanced Prediction System

---

## Executive Summary

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the implementation of Markov Chain methodology to enhance the prediction accuracy of the FormFinder2 football prediction system. The implementation aims to capture temporal dependencies and state transitions in team performance, providing a more sophisticated understanding of team momentum and form dynamics.

### Key Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Improve prediction accuracy by 5-15% through Markov Chain integration
- **Secondary Goals**: 
  - Enhanced momentum detection and trend analysis
  - Improved confidence scoring for predictions
  - Better handling of team performance state transitions
  - Complementary feature engineering to existing models

---

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture Overview

The FormFinder2 system currently employs:

#### Core Prediction Components
1. **Enhanced Predictor** (`enhanced_predictor.py`)
   - Quantile regression models
   - Poisson baseline models
   - XGBoost integration
   - Feature engineering pipeline

2. **Training Engine** (`training_engine.py`)
   - PostgreSQL database integration
   - StandardScaler preprocessing
   - XGBoost model training
   - Date-range based training data loading

3. **Feature Engineering** (`features.py`)
   - Rolling form calculations (last 5 games)
   - Head-to-head statistics
   - Match preview metrics
   - Basic sentiment analysis using TextBlob

#### Database Schema
The current database (`database.py`) includes:
- **PreComputedFeatures**: Team form, H2H stats, league position, sentiment
- **Match-related tables**: Fixture, MatchEvent, MatchOdds, MatchLineup
- **Team data**: Team, League, Standing
- **System monitoring**: HealthChecks, Alerts, PerformanceMetrics

### Current Limitations
1. **Static Feature Engineering**: Limited temporal context beyond rolling averages
2. **Missing State Transitions**: No capture of performance momentum shifts
3. **Linear Relationships**: Current models may miss non-linear state dependencies
4. **Context Insensitivity**: Insufficient consideration of performance state sequences

---

## Markov Chain Solution Architecture

### Theoretical Foundation

#### Markov Chain Principles
A Markov Chain models systems where future states depend only on the current state, not the entire history. For football predictions:

- **States**: Team performance categories (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor, Terrible)
- **Transitions**: Probability of moving between performance states
- **Memory**: Current state captures relevant historical information
- **Prediction**: Future performance based on current state and transition probabilities

#### Mathematical Framework
```
P(X_{t+1} = j | X_t = i, X_{t-1}, ..., X_0) = P(X_{t+1} = j | X_t = i)
```

Where:
- `X_t` represents team performance state at time t
- Transition probability matrix P[i][j] = probability of moving from state i to state j
