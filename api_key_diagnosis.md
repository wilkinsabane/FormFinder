# News API Key Diagnosis Report

## Summary

The multi-provider news API system has been tested and the following issues have been identified:

### Working Providers ✅
- **NewsData.io**: Working correctly (returned 10 articles)
  - API Key: `pub_fdab46...2bc6`
  - Status: ✅ ACTIVE

### Failed Providers ❌

#### 1. NewsAPI
- **Error**: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized
- **Issue**: Invalid API key
- **API Key**: `9a8859df-b...b982`
- **Solution**: Get a new API key from https://newsapi.org/

#### 2. TheNewsAPI
- **Error**: 402 Client Error: Payment Required
- **Issue**: API key quota exceeded or payment required
- **API Key**: `PgjouGehjF...YwaY`
- **Solution**: Upgrade your plan or get a new API key from https://www.thenewsapi.com/

## Current System Status

- **Available Providers**: 1/3 (NewsData.io)
- **System Functionality**: ✅ OPERATIONAL (with reduced capacity)
- **Failover Status**: Working (will use NewsData.io as primary)

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Update NewsAPI Key
```yaml
# In config.yaml, update:
sentiment_analysis:
  providers:
    newsapi:
      api_key: "YOUR_NEW_NEWSAPI_KEY_HERE"
```

### 2. Update TheNewsAPI Key
```yaml
# In config.yaml, update:
sentiment_analysis:
  providers:
    thenewsapi:
      api_key: "YOUR_NEW_THENEWSAPI_KEY_HERE"
```

### 3. Provider Websites
- **NewsAPI**: https://newsapi.org/
- **NewsData.io**: https://newsdata.io/ (currently working)
- **TheNewsAPI**: https://www.thenewsapi.com/

## Technical Details

### Error Analysis
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or expired API key
- **402 Payment Required**: Quota exceeded or subscription required
- **Rate Limiting**: Currently handled by the singleton monitor system

### System Resilience
The multi-provider failover system is working correctly:
- When NewsAPI and TheNewsAPI fail, the system automatically uses NewsData.io
- Rate limiting and cooldown mechanisms are shared across instances
- No "No providers available" errors should occur as long as NewsData.io remains functional

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: The system can continue operating with NewsData.io
2. **Short-term**: Update the failed API keys to restore full redundancy
3. **Long-term**: Monitor API usage and consider upgrading plans if needed

## Testing

To verify fixes after updating API keys:
```bash
python test_api_keys.py
```

This will re-test all providers and confirm they're working correctly.
