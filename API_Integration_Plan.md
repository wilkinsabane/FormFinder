# Soccerdata API Integration Execution Plan

This document outlines a detailed, end-to-end step-by-step plan for successfully integrating the Soccerdata API into the FormFinder project. The plan is structured into phases: Preparation, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each step includes responsibilities, required tools, and success criteria.

## Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Review Project Requirements and API Documentation**
   - Analyze current data fetching logic in `DataFetcher.py` and database models in `database.py`.
   - Map API endpoints to FormFinder's needs (e.g., leagues to League model, fixtures to Fixture model).
   - Success: Documented mapping in a notes section of this plan.

2. **Set Up API Authentication**
   - Obtain an API key (`auth_token`) from Soccerdata.
   - Store the key securely using environment variables or a secrets manager (e.g., update `config.yaml` with a placeholder).
   - Success: API key configured without hardcoding.

3. **Update Dependencies**
   - Add necessary libraries to `requirements.txt` (e.g., `requests` if not present).
   - Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Success: No installation errors; verify with `pip list`.

## Phase 2: Implementation
1. **Modify DataFetcher.py**
   - Create helper functions for API requests (e.g., `fetch_from_api(endpoint, params)` with gzip support and error handling).
   - Implement fetching for key endpoints: countries, leagues, standings, fixtures, live scores, and previews.
   - Integrate with `DatabaseManager` to store fetched data in the database.
   - Handle pagination, rate limits, and retries.
   - Success: Functions tested with mock responses.

2. **Enhance Database Models if Needed**
   - Add fields to models (e.g., for odds or weather from previews) via SQLAlchemy migrations.
   - Update `database.py` accordingly.
   - Success: Schema updated without data loss.

3. **Integrate Predictions**
   - In `PredictorOutputter.py`, hybridize rule-based logic with API predictions (e.g., use `/match-preview` for benchmarks).
   - Update workflows in `workflows.py` to include API calls in the pipeline.
   - Success: Predictions incorporate API data.

4. **Handle Security and Best Practices**
   - Ensure no API keys are committed (update `.gitignore`).
   - Implement logging for API calls in `notifier.py`.
   - Success: Code passes security scans.

## Phase 3: Testing
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write tests for API helper functions using `pytest` and mock responses.
   - Test data mapping to database models.
   - Success: 80%+ coverage with `pytest-cov`.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test end-to-end data flow: API fetch → processing → database storage → prediction output.
   - Use test database instance.
   - Success: No errors in `test_integration.py`.

3. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Simulate API failures, rate limits, and invalid responses.
   - Success: Graceful handling with retries or fallbacks.

## Phase 4: Deployment
1. **Configure Production Environment**
   - Update Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml` for API dependencies.
   - Set up monitoring for API usage (e.g., via Prometheus).
   - Success: Container builds and runs without issues.

2. **Deploy and Monitor**
   - Run deployment scripts (e.g., `setup_database.py`).
   - Monitor initial runs for data accuracy.
   - Success: Live data fetching operational.

## Phase 5: Maintenance
1. **Documentation and Monitoring**
   - Update `README.md` with integration details.
   - Set up alerts for API downtime.
   - Success: Documentation complete; monitoring active.

2. **Iterate Based on Feedback**
   - Review performance and refine (e.g., cache API responses).
   - Plan for API version updates.
   - Success: Integration stable and scalable.

This plan ensures a smooth integration, aligning with FormFinder's goals for enhanced predictions.

## Notes

### API Endpoint to Database Model Mapping
Based on the analysis of DataFetcher.py (which handles API requests with rate limiting and caching) and database.py (which defines models like League, Team, Fixture, Standing, Prediction):
- Leagues: API /leagues → League model
- Seasons/Stages: API /season, /season-stages → League season field
- Teams: API /teams → Team model
- Fixtures/Matches: API /matches, /match → Fixture model
- Standings: API /standing → Standing model
- Predictions/Previews: API /match-preview → Prediction model
- Live Scores: API /live-scores → Fixture updates
- Head-to-Head: API /head-to-head → Used in predictions
This mapping aligns API data with FormFinder's database structure for seamless integration.
