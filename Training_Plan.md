# Football Prediction Algorithm Training Plan

Based on the FormFinder project's architecture and database-stored football data, this document outlines an elaborate plan to train a football prediction algorithm. This plan aligns with FormFinder 2.0's components like `DataFetcher`, `DataProcessor`, `PredictorOutputter`, and the database schema (including tables for Leagues, Teams, Standings, Fixtures, Predictions, and DataFetchLogs). The goal is to predict match outcomes (e.g., win/draw/loss probabilities) using historical and real-time data.

## Relevant Project Information

### Database Schema
- **League**: Stores league details.
- **Team**: Stores team information.
- **Standing**: Tracks team performance metrics like points, goals.
- **Fixture**: Contains match details, scores, dates.
- **Prediction**: For storing generated predictions.
- **DataFetchLog**: Logs data fetching activities.

### Key Files and Components
- `DataFetcher.py`: Handles data fetching from APIs.
- `DataProcessor.py`: Processes fetched data.
- `PredictorOutputter.py`: Outputs predictions (to be extended for ML).
- `database.py`: Manages database interactions via SQLAlchemy.
- `workflows.py`: Orchestrates tasks using Prefect.
- `config.py`: Configuration management.
- `cli.py`: Command-line interface.
- `tests/`: Directory for unit and integration tests.

### Project Structure
The project is structured under `formfinder/` with supporting files like `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, and Docker configurations for deployment.

## Training Plan

### 1. Project Alignment and Requirements Gathering
- **Review Existing Components**: Analyze `PredictorOutputter.py` for any current prediction logic (e.g., basic rule-based predictions). If it exists, extend it; otherwise, add a new module for ML-based predictions.
- **Define Prediction Goals**: Focus on outcomes like match results, scores, or over/under goals. Use data from Fixtures (match details), Standings (team performance), and Teams/Leagues (contextual info).
- **Data Audit**: Query the database to assess data volume, quality, and coverage (e.g., number of leagues, historical depth). Use SQLAlchemy from `database.py` to generate summaries.
- **Tools Needed**: Integrate libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or XGBoost via `requirements.txt`. Ensure compatibility with Prefect workflows in `workflows.py`.

### 2. Data Preparation
- **Extract Data**: Create a data extraction script in `DataProcessor.py` or a new `data_preparation.py` module. Use SQL queries to pull from:
  - **Fixtures**: Historical matches (home/away teams, scores, dates).
  - **Standings**: Metrics like points, goals scored/conceded, form (last 5 games).
  - **Teams/Leagues**: Attributes like team strength, league competitiveness.
  - Filter for completeness (e.g., exclude incomplete seasons).
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values (e.g., impute averages for missing stats), remove duplicates, and normalize formats (e.g., dates to timestamps).
- **Split Dataset**: Divide into training (80%, historical data), validation (10%), and test (10%, recent data) sets. Use time-based splitting to avoid data leakage (e.g., train on pre-2023 data, test on 2023+).
- **Storage**: Save prepared datasets as Parquet files or in a new database table for reproducibility.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Core Features**: Engineer from database tables:
  - Team-based: Form streak, goal difference, home/away performance.
  - Match-based: Head-to-head history, recent form comparison.
  - Contextual: League average goals, weather/venue factors (if available via API extensions in `DataFetcher.py`).
- **Advanced Features**: Calculate Elo ratings, rolling averages, or embeddings for teams.
- **Implementation**: Add a `feature_engineering` function in `DataProcessor.py`. Use Pandas for manipulation and integrate with Pydantic models from `config.py` for validation.
- **Dimensionality**: Apply PCA or feature selection to reduce features (aim for 20-50 key ones).

### 4. Model Selection and Training
- **Algorithm Choices**: Start with simple models like Logistic Regression for baseline, then advance to ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) or neural networks (for complex patterns).
  - Why? Football predictions suit probabilistic models; XGBoost handles imbalanced outcomes well.
- **Training Pipeline**: Use Prefect to orchestrate:
  - Flow: Load data → Engineer features → Train model → Save artifacts.
  - Hyperparameter Tuning: Use Optuna or GridSearchCV, running in a Prefect task.
- **Handling Imbalance**: Use SMOTE for oversampling if win/loss is imbalanced.
- **Implementation**: Create a `train_model` task in `workflows.py`. Store trained models in MLflow or as pickled files.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Validation
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision/recall, Brier score (for probabilities), and log loss. Simulate betting ROI for practical evaluation.
- **Cross-Validation**: Time-series CV to mimic real-world prediction.
- **Backtesting**: Test on historical fixtures to validate predictions against actual outcomes.
- **Integration**: Add evaluation scripts to `tests/` directory, using pytest for automated checks (e.g., `test_model_accuracy.py`).

### 6. Integration into FormFinder
- **Update PredictorOutputter**: Modify `PredictorOutputter.py` to load the trained model and generate predictions for upcoming fixtures fetched by `DataFetcher`.
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Extend Prefect flows in `workflows.py` to include a prediction step after data processing.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Schedule daily runs via Prefect to fetch new data, predict, and store in the Predictions table.
- **Notifications**: Use `notifier.py` to alert on high-confidence predictions.

### 7. Deployment and Monitoring
- **Containerization**: Update `Dockerfile` to include ML dependencies; deploy via `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate Prometheus/Grafana (existing in `docker/`) for model performance metrics.
- **Retraining**: Set up periodic retraining flows in Prefect to update models with new data.
- **Security**: Ensure API keys and database credentials are managed via `config.py`.

### 8. Potential Challenges and Mitigations
- **Data Quality**: Implement validation in `DataFetcher.py` to flag inconsistencies.
- **Scalability**: Use batch processing for large datasets; consider cloud DB if local PostgreSQL limits.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Avoid promoting gambling; focus on analytical insights.
- **Next Steps**: Start with a prototype on a single league, iterate based on evaluation.

This plan leverages the existing database and components for seamless integration.
