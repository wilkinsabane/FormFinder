# Football Data Visualization Dashboard - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Document Information
- **Document Title**: Football Data Visualization Dashboard PRD
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: August 11, 2025
- **Author**: Grok (AI Assistant)
- **Status**: Draft
- **Purpose**: This PRD outlines the requirements for building a web-based dashboard using Streamlit to visualize football data stored in a PostgreSQL database. The dashboard will enable users to interact with and explore data from tables including teams, standings, predictions, leagues, high_form_teams, fixtures, and data_fetch_logs. It leverages existing Python data fetching scripts for efficiency.
- **Audience**: Developers, data analysts, and stakeholders involved in the implementation and use of the dashboard.
- **Revision History**:
  - v1.0: Initial draft based on user requirements and proposed architecture.

## 2. Overview
### 2.1 Problem Statement
The user has football-related data stored in a PostgreSQL database across multiple tables. Currently, there is no easy way to visualize this data in a browser-based interface. Manual querying or exporting data for analysis is inefficient and error-prone. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that allows real-time querying, visualization, and filtering of the data directly from the database, reusing existing Python scripts for data fetching.

### 2.2 Solution Overview
The solution is a Streamlit-based web application that:
- Connects directly to the PostgreSQL database.
- Displays data from each table in dedicated tabs.
- Provides interactive visualizations (e.g., charts, tables) using libraries like Pandas, Plotly, and Matplotlib.
- Includes filters for dynamic querying (e.g., by league, date range).
- Integrates buttons for refreshing data using existing Python fetching scripts.
- Runs locally or can be deployed to cloud platforms for broader access.

Streamlit was selected as the primary tool due to its Python-native simplicity, rapid development cycle, and seamless integration with data tools, making it the most efficient choice for this use case.

### 2.3 Key Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Minimal code required; prototype achievable in 1-2 hours.
- **Interactivity**: Browser-based with real-time updates and user inputs.
- **Reusability**: Leverages existing Python data fetching logic.
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend with more visualizations or features.
- **Cost-Effective**: Open-source and free for basic use.

## 3. Goals and Objectives
### 3.1 Business Goals
- Provide a centralized, user-friendly interface for exploring football data.
- Reduce time spent on manual data analysis by enabling quick visualizations.
- Support decision-making for predictions, standings, and fixtures (e.g., identifying high-form teams).
- Ensure the dashboard is maintainable and extensible for future data tables or features.

### 3.2 User Objectives
- Users (e.g., analysts, fans, developers) should be able to:
  - View raw data tables with sorting and pagination.
  - Interact with visualizations to spot trends (e.g., team performance over time).
  - Apply filters to focus on specific leagues, dates, or teams.
  - Trigger data refreshes without leaving the app.
- The interface should be intuitive, requiring no coding knowledge from end-users.

### 3.3 Success Metrics
- **Development Metrics**: App prototype ready within 1 day; full implementation in 3-5 days.
- **Usage Metrics**: Page load time < 2 seconds; query response time < 1 second for typical datasets.
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on ease of use; ability to handle datasets up to 10,000 rows per table without performance issues.
- **Technical Metrics**: 99% uptime when deployed; caching reduces database hits by 80%.

## 4. Scope
### 4.1 In Scope
- Database connection and querying for all specified tables.
- Tabbed interface for organizing data views.
- Basic visualizations (e.g., bar charts for teams, line charts for standings trends, scatter plots for predictions).
- Sidebar filters (e.g., league selection, date ranges for fixtures and logs).
- Integration of existing Python data fetching scripts via interactive buttons.
- Caching for performance optimization.
- Local deployment and basic cloud deployment instructions.

### 4.2 Out of Scope
- Advanced authentication (e.g., user login systems); assume single-user or open access.
- Real-time data streaming (e.g., live updates without manual refresh).
- Mobile optimization (focus on desktop browser; Streamlit handles basic responsiveness).
- Custom ML model training within the app (visualize predictions only).
- Integration with external APIs beyond existing Python scripts.
- Comprehensive error logging beyond basic Streamlit exceptions.

## 5. User Personas
- **Primary Persona: Data Analyst**
  - Needs: Quick access to standings, predictions, and fixtures; interactive charts for trend analysis.
  - Pain Points: Manual SQL queries; lack of visual insights.
- **Secondary Persona: Developer/Maintainer**
  - Needs: Easy code extensibility; integration with data fetching scripts.
  - Pain Points: Overly complex frameworks; deployment hurdles.
- **Tertiary Persona: Casual User (e.g., Football Fan)**
  - Needs: Simple filters to view high-form teams or upcoming fixtures.
  - Pain Points: Technical barriers to data access.

## 6. Functional Requirements
### 6.1 Core Features
1. **Database Connection**
   - Establish a secure connection to PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy or psycopg2.
   - Support environment variables for credentials (e.g., DB_URI).
   - Handle connection errors gracefully with user-friendly messages.

2. **Data Fetching**
   - Define a reusable function (e.g., `fetch_data(query)`) to execute SQL queries and return Pandas DataFrames.
   - Integrate existing Python scripts for populating/updating tables (e.g., fetch new fixtures and log in `data_fetch_logs`).
   - Add a "Refresh Data" button that triggers these scripts and updates the dashboard.

3. **User Interface Layout**
   - **Title and Header**: Display "Football Data Dashboard" with a subtitle describing the app.
   - **Sidebar**: Include filters like league selector (populated from `leagues` table), date range picker for fixtures/logs, and a refresh button.
   - **Main Content**: Use Streamlit tabs for each table:
     - Tab 1: Teams
     - Tab 2: Standings
     - Tab 3: Predictions
     - Tab 4: Leagues
     - Tab 5: High Form Teams
     - Tab 6: Fixtures
     - Tab 7: Data Fetch Logs
   - Each tab shows a dataframe view and 1-2 visualizations.

4. **Table-Specific Visualizations**
   - **Teams**: Dataframe of all teams; bar chart of points/goals by team name.
   - **Standings**: Dataframe sorted by position; line chart for points over matchdays (if temporal data available).
   - **Predictions**: Dataframe of predictions; scatter plot of predicted vs. actual outcomes; confusion matrix if classification-based.
   - **Leagues**: Dataframe of leagues; pie chart showing team distribution per league.
   - **High Form Teams**: Highlighted dataframe; bar chart of form metrics (e.g., win streaks).
   - **Fixtures**: Dataframe with date filtering; Gantt or calendar chart for schedules.
   - **Data Fetch Logs**: Timeline plot of fetch timestamps; table with success/failure status.

5. **Interactivity**
   - Filters apply dynamically (e.g., select league to filter all relevant tabs).
   - Use Streamlit widgets: selectbox for leagues, date_input for ranges, multiselect for teams.
   - Editable dataframes where appropriate (e.g., for manual predictions adjustments).
   - Tooltips and hover info on charts via Plotly.

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Cache queries with `@st.cache_data(ttl=300)` for 5-minute refresh.
   - Paginate large dataframes (>500 rows).
   - Lazy loading: Fetch data only when a tab is selected.

### 6.2 User Stories
- As a data analyst, I want to filter fixtures by date range so I can focus on upcoming matches.
- As a developer, I want to trigger data refreshes from the app so I don't need to run scripts separately.
- As a user, I want interactive charts so I can zoom/pan to explore trends.
- As a maintainer, I want modular code so I can add new tables easily.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
### 7.1 Performance
- Initial load time: < 5 seconds.
- Query execution: < 2 seconds for complex joins.
- Handle up to 100 concurrent users if deployed (scale with cloud resources).

### 7.2 Security
- Use environment variables or secrets for DB credentials.
- Sanitize SQL queries to prevent injection (use parameterized queries via SQLAlchemy).
- No exposure of sensitive data (e.g., assume all data is public).

### 7.3 Usability
- Intuitive navigation with clear labels.
- Responsive design for browsers (desktop priority).
- Accessibility: Alt text for charts; keyboard navigation.

### 7.4 Reliability
- Graceful error handling (e.g., "No data found" messages).
- Logging of app events to console or file.

### 7.5 Maintainability
- Code organized in a single file initially; refactor to modules if >500 lines.
- Comments and docstrings for key functions.
- Version control with Git.
