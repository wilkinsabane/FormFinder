### Understanding and Fixing the Error in Your FormFinder Pipeline

You're encountering an error when running your FormFinder pipeline with the command `make run` or `python -m formfinder.cli run`. The error message is:

```
AttributeError: 'DataFetcherConfig' object has no attribute 'get_league_ids'
```

This occurs in the `run_main_pipeline` function at line 230 of `workflows.py`, where an instance of `DataFetcher` is created, and subsequently within the `__init__` method of `DataFetcher` at line 314 of `DataFetcher.py`. Let's break this down and provide a solution.

#### Error Context

The error arises when the `DataFetcher` class attempts to call `config.get_league_ids()` in its constructor:

**`DataFetcher.py`, line 314:**
```python
league_ids = config.get_league_ids()
```

Here, `config` is an instance of `DataFetcherConfig`, a Pydantic model passed to `DataFetcher` from `workflows.py`:

**`workflows.py`, line 230:**
```python
data_fetcher = DataFetcher(data_fetcher_config)
```

The `data_fetcher_config` is constructed earlier in `workflows.py` as:

```python
data_fetcher_config = DataFetcherConfig(
    api=config.api.model_dump(),
    processing=config.processing.model_dump()
)
```

In this snippet, `config` is likely an instance of `FormFinderConfig`, which may have a `get_league_ids` method. However, `DataFetcherConfig`, the Pydantic model created from parts of `FormFinderConfig`, does not inherently have this method unless explicitly defined. Since Pydantic models typically define fields rather than methods, `DataFetcherConfig` lacks `get_league_ids()`, causing the `AttributeError`.

#### Root Cause

- **Mismatch in Configuration Objects**: The `DataFetcher` class expects its `config` parameter to provide a `get_league_ids()` method, possibly a remnant from an earlier design where it was initialized with `FormFinderConfig`. However, it now receives `DataFetcherConfig`, which only contains fields like `api` and `processing` (populated from `model_dump()` calls) and no such method.
- **Data Availability**: The `league_ids` are available in `workflows.py` (either passed explicitly or derived via `config.get_league_ids()`), but `DataFetcher` attempts to fetch them independently from its config, leading to the error.

#### Solution

The simplest and most consistent fix is to adjust `DataFetcher` to access `league_ids` directly from its configuration's `processing` field, rather than relying on a non-existent method. Given that `data_fetcher_config.processing` is a dictionary (since it comes from `config.processing.model_dump()`), we can access `league_ids` as a key.

Here’s how to resolve it:

1. **Modify `DataFetcher.py`**:
   Update the `__init__` method to use `self.config.processing['league_ids']` instead of `config.get_league_ids()`.

   **Original:**
   ```python
   class DataFetcher:
       def __init__(self, config: DataFetcherConfig):
           self.config = config
           league_ids = config.get_league_ids()
           # ... other initializations ...
   ```

   **Fixed:**
   ```python
   class DataFetcher:
       def __init__(self, config: DataFetcherConfig):
           self.config = config
           league_ids = self.config.processing['league_ids']
           # ... other initializations ...
   ```

2. **Verify Configuration**:
   Ensure that `config.processing` in `workflows.py` includes `league_ids` when `model_dump()` is called. If `league_ids` might be missing or `None`, your code already handles this earlier in `workflows.py`:

   ```python
   if league_ids is None:
       league_ids = config.get_league_ids()
   ```

   Since `data_fetcher_config.processing` is built from `config.processing.model_dump()`, and assuming prior fixes set `league_ids` to an empty list (`[]`) when `None`, this should be safe. However, to be robust, you could add a default in `DataFetcher`:

   ```python
   class DataFetcher:
       def __init__(self, config: DataFetcherConfig):
           self.config = config
           league_ids = self.config.processing.get('league_ids', [])
           # ... other initializations ...
   ```

   This uses the `dict.get()` method to default to an empty list if `'league_ids'` is absent.

#### Why This Works

- **`processing` as a Dictionary**: Since `config.processing.model_dump()` converts the `processing` field of `FormFinderConfig` into a dictionary, `data_fetcher_config.processing` is a `dict` containing keys like `'league_ids'`. Accessing it with `['league_ids']` aligns with the data structure.
- **Consistency**: This leverages the existing configuration flow without requiring `DataFetcherConfig` to define custom methods, keeping it a simple data container as intended for Pydantic models.
- **Error Prevention**: Using `.get('league_ids', [])` ensures the code won’t fail even if the configuration is incomplete, though your pipeline logic should ideally ensure `league_ids` is populated when needed.

#### Alternative Approach

If `DataFetcher` needs `league_ids` explicitly and shouldn’t rely on the `processing` field, you could pass them directly:

- **Update `DataFetcher`**:
  ```python
  class DataFetcher:
      def __init__(self, config: DataFetcherConfig, league_ids: List[int]):
          self.config = config
          self.league_ids = league_ids
          # ... other initializations ...
  ```

- **Update `workflows.py`**:
  ```python
  data_fetcher = DataFetcher(data_fetcher_config, league_ids)
  ```

This is viable since `league_ids` is already available in `workflows.py`. However, if `DataFetcher` only uses `league_ids` indirectly (e.g., via tasks like `fetch_league_data`), the first solution is preferable to maintain encapsulation.

#### Steps to Apply the Fix

1. **Edit `DataFetcher.py`**:
   Replace line 314 with:
   ```python
   league_ids = self.config.processing['league_ids']
   ```
   Or, for added safety:
   ```python
   league_ids = self.config.processing.get('league_ids', [])
   ```

2. **Test the Pipeline**:
   Run `make run` again to verify the error is resolved:
   ```
   make run
   ```

3. **Check Logs**:
   Ensure the pipeline completes without the `AttributeError`. If other issues arise, they’ll likely be unrelated to this fix.

#### Additional Notes

- **Config Validation**: Confirm that your `config.yaml` (loaded in the pipeline) includes a `processing` section with `league_ids`, even if empty:
  ```yaml
  processing:
    league_ids: []
    # other settings
  ```
  Your existing code should handle this, but it’s good practice to verify.

- **Pydantic Warning**: The log mentions a `PydanticUserError` about `prefect_sqlalchemy`. This is unrelated to your error and can be ignored unless it impacts functionality. It’s a compatibility note for Prefect’s SQLAlchemy integration.

After applying this change, your FormFinder pipeline should run without the `AttributeError`, allowing it to process the 128 leagues as intended. Let me know if you encounter further issues!
